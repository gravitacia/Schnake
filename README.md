  <strong>SyverisDDoS</strong>

# This is only for Minecraft servers.
I don't believe that DDoS will be strong, it's more like a small stress test of your server for vulnerability. Do not forget that your DDoS depends on the power of your abuse server and proxy response. I am not responsible for all your actions. This material was created for protection. You can also run it from your dedicated server or VPS.

# Requirements

Java 21 installed locally.

# Usage

Open the directory where your SyverisDDoS.jar file is located.
Open terminal in this folder.
Launch with java -jar SyverisDDoS.jar

If everything is correct, there will be a window with information on how to start the attack.
Example: java -jar SyverisDDoS.jar 1.1.1.1:25565 340 botjoiner 30 1000
